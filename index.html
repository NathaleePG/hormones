        <p id="head">Did you know that brains have hormones?</p>
        <p id="date">November 15, 2017</p>
        <div id="pic1"></div>
        <p id="bulk">One of the most commonly misunderstood concepts that many non scientists have is the idea about
            where hormones come from. After Claude Bernardâ€™s study on hormones in the 1800s, hormones were defined as
            secretion from the ductless glands. However, scientists nowadays completely debunk this idea. It is known
            today that hormones do not originate in the ductless glands, but instead in the brain. Just like how the
            mitochondria is the energy powerhouse of the cell, think of the brain as the house of hormones. This is
            where they are synthesized, secreted and transported the majority of the time. To be even more specific,
            hormones are generally known as signalling molecules that experience day to day communications between
            other cells and various tissues. They are also largely involved in homeostasis, cell signalling,
            communication and in the information transfer of cells. Hence, being the basis of endocrinology, hormones
            play a vital role in the physiological well being of every species on this planet.<br/><br/>

            <span>The Origin of Life</span><br/>
            Imagine how Earth was like when it was born into this universe. It could have possibly been lifeless, quiet,
            and peaceful, or perhaps it was roaring with giant volcanoes, ruthless earthquakes and heavy rain. But
            besides the fact that the Earth did not contain a single spec of life, hormones were surprisingly present!
            It is known that the first chemical activity that took place on Earth was considered a hormone. These
            hormones were simple of course, such as amino acids or sugars but since they all acquired the same
            characteristics of signalling molecules, they are considered hormones.<br/><br/>

            You may consider two possible origins of hormones during the premature stages of Earth: 1) Extraterrestrial
            origins, where meteorites and organic materials that hit the surface of the Earth contained various organic
            chemical compounds such as amino acids, ketones, alcohols, purines and etc. and 2) Terrestrial origins,
            which were the basic chemical compounds such as amino acids, sugars, ammonia, water and purines that were
            already present on Earth. For the ignition of these chemical compounds, a heat source such as lighting or
            simply the Sun, must have been present.<br/><br/>

            <span>The Brain</span><br/>
            Now that you know where hormones could have possibly originated, the next step is to understand where they
            are found in the body. From our hearts, lungs, arteries, veins and other various tissues of organs,
            hormones are essentially found all over our body. But most importantly, these hormones originally come
            from the brain. Here is where they are mass produced through various chemical reactions in the hypothalamus
            in which they are triggered by the consumption of food. This is why it is so important to feed our bodies
            with the most wholesome and healthiest food so that it is able to produce functional hormones that aid in
            the critical measures of our physiology.<br/><br/>

            As hormones are synthesized in various regions of the brain, they then come in contact with a specific
            region of the brain called the pituitary gland. This is the gland closest to the hypothalamus and it
            consists of two main parts; the anterior lobe (pars distalis) and the posterior lobe (pars nervosa).
            There are also other parts called the median eminence, where hormones produced from the hypothalamus
            are stored and released into the pars distalis and the pars intermedia. The pars intermedia is derived
            from the anterior lobe and is located in between that and the posterior lobe. Now for the sake of
            simplicity, we will remain focused on these two main lobes.<br/><br/>

            The posterior lobe is quite direct. It consists of the neurosecretory terminal which originate from cells
            in the hypothalamus. The two main hormones that are stored in the lobe are known as vasopressin/ADH and
            oxytocin. These are stress hormones and they aid in various functions in the body such as osmoregulation
            and reproduction respectively to name a few. Vasotocin is also released from here but this is only found
            in fish. These hormones are then released into the blood stream to be transported to various tissues of
            our body. On the other hand, the anterior lobe is a much more complicated organ. Neuroendocrines from the
            hypothalamus secrete releasing hormones such as growth hormone releasing hormones and thyrotropinreleasing
            hormones to name a few, into the anterior lobe. Blood vessels which interact with the nerve endings of the
            neuroendocrines are then transported through the portal system. The portal system consists of blood vessels
            that direct the blood towards secretory cells. The neurohormones come into direct contact with the
            secretory cells to signal them to release specific tropic hormones. In this case, the growth hormone
            releasing hormone tells the secretory cell to release growth hormones while the thyrotropinreleasing
            hormone tells the secretory cell to release thyrotropin. These tropic hormones leave the gland via the
            blood stream and is then transported to various parts of the body such as the reproductive system and
            the thyroid gland.<br/><br/>

            In the blood stream, hormones are specifically designed to attach to proteins or lipids in which they are
            directed towards receptors on the membranes of tissues. The hormones attach to the receptors to either
            activate or inhibit signal transduction pathways to produce specific physiological effects. Many of these
            effects can become quite complex however, I will anticipate you by saving it for another blog entry!<br/><br/>

            <span>In Conclusion</span><br/>
            Now that you have finally learned a glimpse of what hormones are and how they are mediated throughout the
            body, you may now give yourself a pat on the back for learning something new! Yes, you are smarter than
            you ever were before so now you may spread this knowledge to your friends, peers and family! Let it
            excite you and bring about the awareness of its importance! The brain is a powerful thing and we shall
            always take advantage of it as it is truly, the superpower of our existence!<br/><br/>
